Some examples are provided here. Example 1: The task is: Move from 1,2 to 6,4. Robot type 1 could perform the task, simply by moving between the two coordinates and it is faster than the other types of robots. Robot type 2 could perform the task, simply by moving between the two coordinates, but the robotic arm with a gripper as TCP is not necessary to perform the task. Robot type 3 could perform the task, simply by moving between the two coordinates, but the front loader is not necessary to perform the task. Example 2: The task is: Grab a glass from the table at 0,5 and move it to 7,1. Robot type 1 could not perform the task, since it has no way of grabbing the glass. Robot type 2 could perform the task by moving to the first coordinate (0,5), grabbing the glass with the robotic arm with a gripper as TCP and then moving to the second coordinate (7,1). Robot type 3 could not perform the task, since the front loader is not suitable for grabbing light single objects, and it has no way of reaching the glass on the table. Example 3: The task is: Move a pile of small rocks from 10,7 to 5,1. Robot type 1 could not perform the task, since it has no way of picking up the small rocks. Robot type 2 could perform the task by moving to the first coordinate (10,7), grab a small rock, move to the second coordinate (5,1), and repeat this pattern until all the rocks are moved. Robot type 3 could perform the task by moving to the first coordinate (10,7), picking up all the small rocks with the front loader and then move to the second coordinate (5,1).
