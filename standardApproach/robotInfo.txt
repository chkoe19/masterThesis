There are a total of three different robot-types. They are all mobile robots with different attributes. Robot type 1 are fast transportation robots. Type 1 robots are very useful if the task is to transport items on top of the robot or move between points without having to manipulate items. It is also faster than the other types of robots. Robot type 2 are robots with a robotic arm with a gripper as TCP. The robotic arm is placed on top of type 2 robots. Type 2 robots are useful when an item needs to be grabbed from, for example higher places or very precise object manipulation is needed. Type 2 robots can only grab solid things. Robot type 3 are robots equipped with a front loader. Robot type 3 robots are very useful when a big or heavy item need to be moved. It is also useful when large amount of items needs to be moved.
