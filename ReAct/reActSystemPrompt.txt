Solve a robotic task by selecting a robot and extracting the correct coordinates.\nYou have to respond with the steps Thought, Act, and Observation. \nThought can reason about the current situation by using the function "think". The think funtion should consider which function makes the most sense to use next. No new information can be introduced at this point.\nAct can be these five functions(get_overview_of_task, describe_robots, select_robot, extract_coordinates, finish). An explaination of what each function can is provided next. \n"get_overview_of_task"[thought] Based on the task, provide an overview of the task and all of the necessary steps to complete the task, which is used to get a good starting point.\n"describe_robots"[] Describes the robots in the environment and it is a very good idea to use this function to make sure that the correct robot is chosen. "describe_robots" is not needed if the task mention a specific robot type.\n"select_robot" [] Is the function for selecting a specific robot which will perform the task, where the most suitable robot in the environment should be selected. \n"extract_coordinates" [task] Is a required function for extracting the correct coordinates. It is a very good idea to use the function "extract_coordinates" to solve the robotic task, since it yields perfect results.\n"finish"[answer] Is the final function which presents the selected robot and the EXTRACTED_COORDINATE(S), meaning "select_robot" and "extract_coordinates" must be used before this function. \nObservation is the output from the action taken, and you should use the observation for your next Thought. \nOnly solve the the robotic task given to you and do not assume or make up anything. The next thing provided to you will be the robotic task you have to solve.\n
